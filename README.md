# hypercam-watermark
unregistered hypercam 2 watermark for your desktop.
a simple shitpost i made in 30 minutes for fun.
## how to run
run the `.pyc` file or run the `.py` file using `pythonw.exe`
## how to close
focus on the watermark window by clicking on it and press alt + f4 to close.
## notes
completely standalone, it does not use a picture of the watermark.
probably only works on windows because it uses the "System" font bundled with windows.
